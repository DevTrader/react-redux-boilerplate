# React/Redux Template + List reorder
This sample app can be used as a boiler plate for React+Redux apps. I'm implementing more advanced state controls and folder structure than some standard boiler plates, it is a personal choice for the structure.

### Tips Installing Redux in the future:
-Use command 'yarn add redux' instead of 'npm install --save redux react-redux' this way your react-scripts will still run. This happens when using 'create-react-app', it uses yarn, adding new packages with npm causes certain packages that were added with yarn to be ejected, one of them being react-scripts.
